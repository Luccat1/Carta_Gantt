# Plan 2.2 Summary: Conditional Formatting

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Implemented `applyOverlapConditionalFormatting_` in `Gantt.gs`.
- [x] Applied formula logic `=AND($F2<=WeekEnd, $G2>=WeekStart)`.
- [x] Integrated formatting call into `refreshGanttView`.

## Verification
- Code exists in `Gantt.gs`.
- Logic addresses the "anchor bug" by using `$F2` and `$G2` (absolute column, relative row).
