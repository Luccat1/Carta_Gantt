# Fix: Documentation Hygiene

## Problem
Audit found: (1) TODO.md has 85 unchecked items despite most being implemented. (2) VERIFICATION.md files missing for phases 8, 9, 10.

## Root Cause
TODO.md was the original brain-dump and was never maintained as a living checklist. Verification files were generated for phases 4-7 but the pattern was not carried forward.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Clean up TODO.md
- **File**: `TODO.md`
- **Action**: Mark all implemented items as `[x]`. Move the 5 deferred items to a new `## Backlog` section at the bottom. Remove the `## 🔴 Bugs actuales` section (all bugs resolved).
- **Verify**: Count of `- [ ]` items matches the 5 deferred features.
- **Done**: TODO.md reflects actual project state.

### Task 2: Backfill VERIFICATION.md for Phase 8
- **File**: `.gsd/phases/8/VERIFICATION.md`
- **Action**: Create verification file listing Phase 8 must-haves (auto-estados, sidebar, rollover, plantillas) with evidence from `Main.gs`, `Rollover.gs`, `Sidebar.html`.
- **Done**: File exists with correct evidence.

### Task 3: Backfill VERIFICATION.md for Phase 9
- **File**: `.gsd/phases/9/VERIFICATION.md`
- **Action**: Create verification file listing Phase 9 must-haves (AppSheet config, triggers, instructions) with evidence from `Config.gs`, `Main.gs`.
- **Done**: File exists with correct evidence.

### Task 4: Backfill VERIFICATION.md for Phase 10
- **File**: `.gsd/phases/10/VERIFICATION.md`
- **Action**: Create verification file listing Phase 10 must-haves (Calendar sync, Drive, Gmail) with evidence from `CalendarSync.gs`, `DriveManager.gs`, `Notifications.gs`.
- **Done**: File exists with correct evidence.
