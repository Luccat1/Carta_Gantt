# Plan 7.2 Summary: Filtered Views (By Project & By Responsible)

## Changes
- **Config.gs**: Added `SHEET_VIEWS`.
- **Main.gs**: 
    - Updated `initStructure` to ensure the `VIEWS` sheet exists and is protected.
    - Added a "Vistas 📂" submenu to "Gantt ⚙️" with items: "Vista por Proyecto" and "Vista por Responsable".
- **Gantt.gs**: 
    - Implemented `viewByProject()` and `viewByResponsible()`.
    - Created `generateGroupedView_()` helper to handle the grouping and formatting logic.
    - Views include bold headers for groups, sub-headers for tasks, and are sorted by start date.

## Verification Results
- `initStructure` creates the `VIEWS` sheet correctly.
- `viewByProject` correctly groups tasks under project icons.
- `viewByResponsible` correctly groups tasks under person icons.
- Data is cleared before each generation to ensure a clean snapshot.
