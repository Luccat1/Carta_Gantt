# Summary 5.2: Validation Engine with ISSUES Output

## Accomplishments
- Refactored `Validation.gs`:
    - Implemented `runFullValidation()` as a wrapper.
    - Added `validateProjectsData_()` to check `PROJECTS` sheet.
    - Updated `validateTasksData_()` to check task IDs and project existence.
    - Validation results are now written to the `ISSUES` sheet as structured rows.
- Updated `Main.gs`:
    - Menu item "Validar datos" now calls `runFullValidation()`.
- Enhanced validation rules:
    - Unique ID enforcement for both projects and tasks.
    - Cross-reference integrity: Tasks must belong to an existing project.
    - Improved date logic and status/enum checks.

## Verification
- Code follows the structure `[timestamp, sheet, row, field, message, severity]`.
- Summary alert logic implemented correctly.
