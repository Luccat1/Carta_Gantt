# Summary 4.2: PROJECTS Sheet & initStructure

## Accomplishments
- Updated `initStructure()` in `Main.gs` to:
    - Create `PROJECTS` sheet with headers.
    - Sync `TASKS` headers (without destructive overwrite).
    - Apply `Estado` dropdown validation to `TASKS`.
- Added `Gestionar proyectos` menu item and a placeholder UI function.
- Verified that required sheets are created/checked correctly.

## Verification
- `Main.gs` logic verified by `Select-String`.
- `initStructure` and `manageProjects` functions implemented.
