# Plan 6.2 Summary: Project-Color Gantt Bars

## Changes
- **Gantt.gs**: 
    - Updated `refreshGanttView` to extract project names and colors from the `PROJECTS` sheet into a `projectColorMap`.
    - Replaced `applyOverlapConditionalFormatting_` (rules-based) with `applyOverlapFormatting_` (direct coloring).
    - `applyOverlapFormatting_` uses the `projectColorMap` to set cell backgrounds directly in a single batch operation (`setBackgrounds`).
    - Tasks without a defined project color in `PROJECTS` fallback to `DEFAULT_COLOR`.

## Verification Results
- Gantt bars now reflect the colors defined in the `PROJECTS` sheet.
- Performance improved by switching from per-column conditional rules to a single batch background update.
- Limit of 100 conditional rules is no longer a risk.
