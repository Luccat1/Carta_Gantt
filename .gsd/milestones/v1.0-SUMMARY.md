# Milestone: v1.0 - Foundation & Core

## Completed: 2026-02-16

## Deliverables
- ✅ Automated Gantt visualization
- ✅ Menu-driven management
- ✅ Safe annual accounting (rollover)
- ✅ User Documentation (README)

## Phases Completed
1. Phase 1: Foundation & Calendar
2. Phase 2: Core Visualization
3. Phase 3: Robustness & Safety

## Metrics
- Total Phases: 3
- Critical Features: Gantt View, Rollover, Validation

## Lessons Learned
- **Architecture**: Keeping logic in separate files (`Rollover.gs`, `Gantt.gs`) kept `Main.gs` clean.
- **Formulas**: Solving the anchor bug in conditional formatting required specific absolute/relative referencing (`$F2`).
- **User UX**: Adding a menu was critical for usability over manual scripts.
