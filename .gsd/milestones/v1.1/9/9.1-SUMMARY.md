# Plan 9.1 Summary: Data Normalization for AppSheet

## Changes
- **Helpers.gs**:
    - Added `ensureRowIds_(sheet, colName)`: Fills missing IDs in TASKS (`ID`) and PROJECTS (`ProyectoID`).
- **Config.gs**:
    - Added `SHEET_APPSHEET` ('APPSHEET_CONFIG') and its headers.
- **Main.gs**:
    - `initStructure()`:
        - Now initializes the `APPSHEET_CONFIG` sheet with project-specific metadata (keys, refs, etc.).
        - Calls `ensureRowIds_` for both main tables.

## Verification Results
- All tasks and projects are guaranteed to have unique stable IDs.
- `APPSHEET_CONFIG` provides a single source of truth for AppSheet table configuration.
