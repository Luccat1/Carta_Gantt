# Summary 4.3: Migrate Existing Scripts

## Accomplishments
- Migrated `Gantt.gs`:
    - `refreshGanttView` now uses `getHeaderMap_` for dynamic column counts and header resolution.
    - `applyOverlapConditionalFormatting_` now takes `hMap` and uses `colToLetter_` to build formulas like `=$H2<=DATE(...)`.
- Migrated `Rollover.gs`:
    - Resolved `Fin` column dynamically.
    - Updated archive and rewrite logic to handle dynamic column counts.
- Migrated `Validation.gs`:
    - Resolved `Proyecto`, `Tarea`, `Inicio`, `Fin`, and `Estado` dynamically.
    - Added mandatory check for `Proyecto` and `Tarea`.
    - Added enum check for `Estado`.

## Verification
- Scripts verified by `Select-String` for `getHeaderMap_` usage.
- Logical flow reviewed for dynamic index resolution.
