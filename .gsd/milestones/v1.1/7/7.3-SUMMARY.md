# Plan 7.3 Summary: Auto-Sync & Documentation

## Changes
- **Gantt.gs**: 
    - Updated `refreshGanttView()` to automatically call `refreshDashboard()` after `refreshTimelineData()`. This ensures the dashboard stays in sync with the latest Gantt data.
- **README.md**: 
    - Added descriptions for `TIMELINE_DATA`, `DASHBOARD`, and `VIEWS` sheets.
- **.gsd/SPEC.md**: 
    - Marked TIMELINE_DATA (Phase 6) as completed.
    - Added and marked as completed the Phase 7 success criteria: "Dashboard KPIs computed from live data" and "Filtered views by project and responsible".

## Verification Results
- `Gantt.gs` includes the auto-sync call.
- README and SPEC documentation reflect the current state of the project.
